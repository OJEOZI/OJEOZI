### Hi, 👋🏻 I'm Samuel Ojeozi,

I go through your organisation's data, tell you how your organisation is doing, tell you why it's doing so and tell you how it could do better.
Having trouble gathering, organising or understanding your business data? Well, that's where I come in.

I gather and analyze relevant data to provide your organisation with information that will effectively aid your decision-making process. I point organisations to information hidden in their data; informations that would've otherwise gone unnoticed or ignored.

## Skills and Experience
